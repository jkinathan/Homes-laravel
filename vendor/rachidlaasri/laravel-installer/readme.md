 - `public/installer/assets` : This folder contains a css folder and inside of it you will find a `main.css` file, this file is responsible for the styling of your installer, you can overide the default styling and add your own.
 - `resources/views/vendor/installer` : This folder contains the HTML code for your installer, it is 100% customizable, give it a look and see how nice/clean it is.
 - `resources/lang/en/messages.php` : This file holds all the messages/text, currently only English is available, if your application is in another language, you can copy/past it in your language folder and modify it the way you want.
